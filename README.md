This repo contains the slides and supporting code for my tutorial on [reinforcement learning and MPC at Upper Bound 2024](https://www.upperbound.ai/speakers/SPEWNJXVTAX).

At some point, I will also post a link to a companion paper I am working on. You can follow updates here or follow me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Fe9p7QoAAAAJ&hl).
